Fileshare API
üöÄ Overview

Welcome to the Fileshare API! This project aims to provide a robust, secure, and highly performant file sharing service built with Rust. Our goal is to offer a comprehensive set of features for managing, sharing, and collaborating on files, leveraging Rust's strengths in concurrency, memory safety, and performance.
‚ú® Current Features

Our Fileshare API currently supports the following core functionalities:

    üì§ File Upload: Securely upload files to the system.

    üì• File Download: Retrieve files efficiently.

    üìù User Sign Up: Create new user accounts.

    üîë User Login: Authenticate existing users.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap: Enhancing the Fileshare API with Rust

This roadmap outlines the planned stages for expanding the Fileshare API. Each phase introduces new features and highlights the key Rust concepts that will be central to their implementation, offering opportunities to dive deeper into Rust's powerful ecosystem.
Phase 1: Core System & Data Foundation

This phase focuses on solidifying the basic file and folder management capabilities, along with fundamental data structures and reliable error handling in Rust.

Features to Implement:

    Folder Management: Allow users to create, rename, move, and delete folders, supporting hierarchical structures.

    File Renaming and Deletion: Implement API endpoints for renaming existing files and securely deleting them.

    Basic Metadata Management: Store and retrieve essential file metadata such as file size, upload timestamp, original filename, and content type.

    Admin User Management: Create endpoints for an administrator to view, create, update, and delete user accounts, laying the groundwork for broader permission systems.


Phase 2: Secure Sharing & Versioning

This phase introduces advanced sharing capabilities, robust data versioning, and resource management.

Features to Implement:

    Shareable Links with Controls:

        Generate unique, shareable URLs for files/folders.

        Add options for password protection, expiration dates, and optional download limits on links.

    Version Control: Automatically save previous file versions on new uploads and provide endpoints to list and revert to specific older versions.

    Storage Quotas: Implement per-user storage limits and prevent uploads if quotas are exceeded.


Phase 3: Eventing, Security & Scalability

This phase introduces real-time notifications, enhanced security measures, and patterns for handling concurrent operations.

Features to Implement:

    Webhooks: Allow users to register URLs to receive real-time notifications for specific events (e.g., file uploaded, file deleted).

    Audit Logs: Maintain detailed logs of all significant user and system actions for security and compliance.

    Rate Limiting: Implement mechanisms to control API request frequency per user/IP to prevent abuse and ensure service stability.

    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) API Support: Provide endpoints for managing 2FA/MFA, including code generation and verification.

    Virus Scanning Integration: Integrate with an external virus scanning service to scan uploaded files before they are made fully available.

rror Handling (Context and Propagation): Leverage crates like anyhow or thiserror to add rich context to errors, making debugging more efficient.

Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience & Analytics

This final phase focuses on improving the user experience with features like file previews and advanced search, along with providing valuable insights.

Features to Implement:

    File Previews: Generate direct preview links or embed a preview mechanism for supported file types (images, PDFs, text).

    Advanced Search and Filtering: Implement full-text search (searching within file contents) and more sophisticated filtering options based on metadata, date ranges, or file sizes.

    API Key Management: For a public-facing API, provide endpoints for developers to generate, revoke, and monitor their API keys.

    Basic Analytics and Reporting: Expose aggregated data on file downloads, storage usage trends, and popular files.
